GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, 
branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own
Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s
Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
A repository is usually used to organize a single project.
Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos,
spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.
We recommend including a README, or a file with information 
about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the 
same time you create your new repository. It also offers other
common options such as a license file.
